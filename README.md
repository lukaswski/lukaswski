# I am a mechatronics specialist who loves IoT devices 🦾🤖❤️

Every day I solve problems, detecting hidden electric bugs and
fixing them. I am fan of new technologies and startup
environments. I have been studying front end technologies and few more,
over one and half years to become a great front end developer.
